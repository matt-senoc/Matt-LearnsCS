# My Computer Science Projects üßë‚Äçüíª

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a **2nd-year Computer Science student**, and this is where I showcase my projects, experiments, and code from my coursework and personal learning journey.

Here you'll find a collection of my work, exploring core concepts in programming and software development. My goal is to build **clean**, **functional**, and **well-documented** applications that demonstrate my skills and passion for technology.

## My Learning Journey üöÄ

I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in the following areas:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
  Implementing foundational data structures (like stacks, queues, and linked lists) and solving algorithmic problems to build a strong theoretical base.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Designing software using classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for scalable and maintainable code.

- **Web Development**  
  Building responsive websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React or Vue.

- **Databases**  
  Designing and managing relational and non-relational databases using SQL, MongoDB, and other tools.

- **Version Control & Collaboration**  
  Using Git and GitHub for source control, collaboration, and project management.
